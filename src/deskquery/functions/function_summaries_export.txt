Computes mean utilization of workspace utilization over a given timeframe, grouped by either desk, room, or weekday.
Should only be used to group by one of those attributes.

Utilization is defined as the number of actual bookings divided by the number of possible bookings per group.
The possible bookings depend on the time window, included weekdays, selected desk_ids or selected room_names.

Optionally, the result can be filtered by a threshold or by selecting only the top or bottom N utilization values by 
providing a threshold and selecting with from_bottom = True all entities where utilization <= threshold or with
False utilization >= threshold. The same goes with the top_or_bottom_n where from_bottom = False means the top N
utilizations and with from_bottom = True the bottom N utilizations.

Identifies utilization outliers based on deviation from the global mean.

This function detects keys (desks, rooms, or weekdays) whose average utilization deviates significantly 
from the global mean (by at least the given threshold). It uses the same aggregation logic as 
`analyze_utilization` and returns only the outlier entries.

Identifies pairs of users who frequently book on the same days and calculates co-booking statistics.
